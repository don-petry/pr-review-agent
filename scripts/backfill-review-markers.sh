# Backfill missing `<!-- pr-review-agent v1 sha=<SHA> -->` markers onto
# fix-request comments posted by the bot that predate the fix in
# post-pr-review.sh (PR #134).
#
# For each target PR:
#   1. Fetch current head SHA.
#   2. Find issue comments by BOT_USER whose body matches the fix-request
#      pattern ("## Review — fix requested") but lacks the marker.
#   3. PATCH each such comment to prepend the marker using the PR's current
#      head SHA and the risk level extracted from the comment body (or MEDIUM
#      as a safe default).
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/backfill-review-markers.sh <pr-url> [<pr-url> ...]
#
#   # Or pipe a list:
#   cat prs.txt | xargs bash scripts/backfill-review-markers.sh
#
# Env:
#   GH_TOKEN   — PAT with repo read + issues write (defaults to env or gh auth)
#   BOT_USER   — bot login to filter by (default: donpetry-bot)
#   DRY_RUN    — "true" to print what would change without patching (default: false)
